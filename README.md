## Description
This project demonstrates how an API for a social media platform could be built using MongoDB, Express and JavaScript. The API allows the user to create social network `users` and then post `thoughts` by those `users` through the backend using Postman. Additionally, `friends` can be associated to `users` and `reactions` can be associated to `thoughts` posted by other `users`.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- DayJS
- Node.JS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Postman
    
## Usage 
1. Download the source files or fork the repo on Github
2. Make sure you have all of the technologies above installed on your machine
3. Manipulate the controller, model routes and config files as needed
4. From terminal run `node index`
5. Using Postman, enter the routes,paraemters and corresponding methods ( `Get`, `Post`, `Put`, `Delete`)
